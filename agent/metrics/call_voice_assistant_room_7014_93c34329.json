It measures around 20 different biomarkers that cover things like cholesterol, blood sugar, thyroid function, iron levels, and inflammation. This test gives you a really complete picture of what's affecting your energy and overall health. Would you like to know more about what specifically it measures?"

But when I go through your project,  you can see that energy panel kit.  I found that biomarkers are not correct because when I discussed personally with a doctor, he told me that this energy panel is not working correctly."

I can understand how frustrating that must be, especially when it comes to something as important as your health. I want to help you understand what might have gone wrong. The Energy Panel does measure biomarkers related to blood sugar, such as glucose, hemoglobin A1C, and insulin. However, it's possible that the results may not have been accurate or comprehensive enough for your specific needs. I'm not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand the results you got. Just to be clear, I'm not able to provide medical advice or diagnosis. For any health concerns or if you see red markers in your results, it's best to consult with your healthcare provider who knows your complete health history. Would you like me to explain any specific part of your results, or would you like me to connect you with our support team to look into this further?"
