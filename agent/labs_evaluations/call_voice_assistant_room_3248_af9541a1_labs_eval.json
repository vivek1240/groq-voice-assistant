The results are presented in a clear and easy-to-understand format, with a color-coding system to help you quickly see where you're doing well and where there might be room for improvement. Green indicates that your biomarker is within the optimal range, yellow means it's slightly outside the optimal range, and red indicates that it's significantly outside the normal range. We also provide explanations for each biomarker, so you can understand what it measures and why it's important for your health. Additionally, I'm here to help you understand your results and answer any questions you may have. I can explain the biomarkers, the reference ranges, and what the results mean in simple terms, so you can feel confident and empowered to take control of your health. Does that make sense?"
