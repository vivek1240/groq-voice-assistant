For example, if your results show that your cholesterol levels are a bit higher than they should be, you can use that information to make changes to your diet and exercise routine to help bring those levels down. Or, if your thyroid function is a bit off, you can talk to your healthcare provider about what that might mean for your overall health and what steps you can take to get your thyroid function back on track.

Fasting helps ensure that your test results are as accurate as possible, especially for things like blood sugar and cholesterol levels.

It's an ancient Indian text that's part of the Hindu epic, the Mahabharata.

The text explores various themes such as duty, ethics, and spiritual growth, and it's considered one of the most important and influential Hindu scriptures.

It says:  \""Sarva-dharman parityajya, Mamekam saranam vraja, Aham tvam sarva-papebhyo, Moksayisyami ma suchah\""  This verse can be translated to:  \""Abandon all varieties of dharma and just surrender unto Me alone. I shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear\"". In this verse, Lord Krishna is telling Arjuna to let go of all his doubts, fears, and attachments to worldly duties and responsibilities, and to simply surrender to Him. Krishna promises that if Arjuna surrenders to Him, He will take care of all his sins and imperfections, and will grant him liberation. This verse is often seen as a call to surrender one's ego and individual will to a higher power, and to trust in the divine guidance and protection. It's a message of hope and reassurance, reminding us that we don't have to carry the burden of our mistakes and weaknesses alone, but can instead rely on a higher power to guide and support us. In the context of the Bhagavad Gita as a whole, this verse is a culmination of the teachings on the importance of devotion, surrender, and selflessness. It's a reminder that the ultimate goal of spiritual growth is not to achieve some kind of personal gain or recognition, but to surrender our individual ego and will to a higher power, and to merge with the divine.
